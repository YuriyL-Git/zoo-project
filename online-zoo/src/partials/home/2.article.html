    <p class="article__par-one">The site was founded on the basis of a volunteer movement to protect and care for
      animals.</p>
    <h3 class="article__subtitle">How it works</h3>
    <p class="article__par-two">The main goal is to help the animals, as well as the nature reserves and zoos where they
      are kept. We are currently working on video projects targeting pandas in China, eagles on an island near Los
      Angeles, alligators in Florida and gorillas in the Congo. These have a total of more than 1,500 mammals and
      reptiles.</p>
