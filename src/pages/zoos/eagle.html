        Eagles choose a mate for life. They <a class="info-section__link" href="#"> build large </a> and strong nests,
        using branches. They lay two eggs each. While
        the female incubates them, the male takes care of her feeding. The hatched offspring can be seen immediately,
        and are covered with down. The nature of the predator forces the chicks from a young age to fight for their
        survival. Often one can observe the larger chick trying to push the younger brother out of the nest. Sometimes
        it may even kill it by fighting for food. In cases where there is enough food, several chicks grow in the nests.

      </p>
      <p class="info-section__paragraph">
        The eagle is a bird of prey in the hawk family. It is one of the largest birds. The body length of an adult bird
        varies from 73 to 89 cm, with long wings up to 2.5 m in wingspan, a short tail and strong paws. The massive beak
        and sharp claws are the main weapons of this raptor.
      </p>
      <p class="info-section__paragraph">
        Excellent vision allows the eagle to spot a mouse, snake, or lizard from a great height. The eyeball is large
        and occupies a lot of space in the skull, so eye mobility is low, but the well-developed neck makes up for this
        <a class="info-section__link" href="#">disadvantage</a>. Eagles use their hearing more for communication than
        for hunting. The sense of smell is poorly
        developed.

        They usually hunt alone. The eagle may hover for a long time at a high altitude, looking for prey, or sit on an
        elevated position and observe the surroundings in search of prey. As a rule, only killed prey goes as food,
        carrion rarely makes it into their <a class="info-section__link" href="#">diet</a>. It all depends on the type
        of bird. It can be both insects and large
        mammals. At the moment of attack, the eagle sharply lowers down, grabs the victim with its paws and strikes it
        with its beak. The stunned creature is no longer able to resist.
